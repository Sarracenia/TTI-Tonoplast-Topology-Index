**Sample data description**

<p>Purpose of the Sample data is to provide a visual feedback about the expected data structure, that could facilitate troubleshooting in case your TTI measurement is not going as expected.</p>
<p><i>And it was also requested by a reviewer of our publication.</i></p>

* <a href="Sample data/sample-image.tif" target="_blank">Sample-image</a> shows image with single optical section suited for TTI measurement, which can be used for testing purposes. Please note, that more data are available at the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD2226" target="_blank">repository</a>.

* <a href="/Sample data/sample-image-rois.png" target="_blank">Sample-image-rois</a> illustrates how to draw regions of interest to measure the TTI, in case it is not clear from the <a href="/TTI_manual_v1.pdf" target="_blank">manual</a> (Stage 1 point 10) or macro instructions.

* <a href="/Sample data/Stage 1 data" target="_blank">Stage 1 Sample data</a> shows expected output files from the <a href="stage1_v1.ijm" target="_blank">stage 1 macro </a>, that will be loaded into <a href="stage2_v1.ipynb" target="_blank">Stage 2 jupyter notebook</a>.

* <a href="/Sample data/sample-histogram.png" target="_blank">Sample histogram</a> shows a typical histogram from Stage 2 with correctly detected peaks. Default filter parameters were used.

* <a href="/Sample data/sample_output.xlsx" target="_blank">Sample output table</a> shows output table generated by processing the Sample data.

<p>All sample data were generated using top3a.ome.tiff image from the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD2226" target="_blank">repository</a>.</p>
